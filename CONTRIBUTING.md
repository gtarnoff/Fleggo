# So you want to help? Awesome!

Here are a couple things I ask:

- Be nice. I made Fleggo for something I need, and thought others can use it. If
  I or any other contributor feels harrassed, I will just close it off.
- This is my project. I will debate fiercely, but compromise accordingly.
  Ultimately thought, it is my decision if I accept a PR.

## Contributing process
- File an issue first so we can discuss what you think needs to happen.
- Once the action plan and debate is over...
- Create a branch for your change. 
- File the PR noting the Issue #
- Please use semantic versioning.
